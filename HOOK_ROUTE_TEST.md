# Hook Route Implementation Fix

This document describes the fix for the hook route implementation for lobby API endpoints.

## Problem Identified

The client code in `client/src/screens/lobby.rs` was making HTTP API requests to `/lobby/api/rooms` endpoints:
- `GET /lobby/api/rooms` (list rooms)
- `POST /lobby/api/rooms` (create room)
- `POST /lobby/api/rooms/{id}/leave` (leave room)

However, the Caddyfile proxy configuration only had routes for `/hook/*` and `/matchmaker/*`, but not `/lobby/*`. This caused 404 errors when the client tried to interact with the bevygap lobby service.

## Root Cause

The bevygap lobby service (running on port 3001) provides HTTP API endpoints for room management, but the reverse proxy was not configured to route `/lobby/*` requests to this service.

## Solution Implemented

Added the missing route to `Caddyfile`:
```caddyfile
# Lobby API endpoints - direct routing to lobby service
handle /lobby/* {
    reverse_proxy lobby:3001
}
```

This ensures requests to `/lobby/api/rooms` are correctly proxied to the bevygap lobby service.

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Environment variables configured for production deployment

### Production Testing
1. Deploy using `docker-compose.prod.yml`
2. Ensure lobby service is running on port 3001
3. Test the API endpoints:

```bash
# Test room listing
curl -X GET https://voidloop.quest/lobby/api/rooms

# Test room creation (if lobby service supports it)
curl -X POST https://voidloop.quest/lobby/api/rooms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"host_name":"test","game_mode":"casual","max_players":4}'

# Test leaving room (if lobby service supports it)
curl -X POST https://voidloop.quest/lobby/api/rooms/test-room/leave \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"player_name":"test"}'
```

### Expected Results
- Requests should be proxied to the lobby service running on port 3001
- No more 404 errors for `/lobby/api/*` endpoints
- Client can successfully create, list, and leave rooms

### Local Development
For local development, you may need to:
1. Uncomment the lobby service in `docker-compose.localdev.yml`
2. Add proxy configuration for the development server
3. Or use a development proxy like nginx locally

## Routes Summary

The Caddyfile now includes:
- `/matchmaker/*` → matchmaker-httpd:3000 (WebSocket and HTTP)
- `/lobby/*` → lobby:3001 (HTTP API for rooms)
- `/hook/*` → lobby:3001 (Webhook endpoints)
- `/health` → Health check response
- `/` → client:80 (Static game files)
