echo "=========================================="

echo ""
echo "üîê Security Problem Fixed:"
echo "  BEFORE: Client had direct access to EDGEGAP_TOKEN (insecure)"
echo "  AFTER:  Only matchmaker service has EDGEGAP_TOKEN (secure)"

echo ""
echo "üìä New Architecture:"
echo "  1. Client makes HTTP request to matchmaker service"
echo "  2. Matchmaker service uses EDGEGAP_TOKEN to call Edgegap API" 
echo "  3. Matchmaker service returns connection info to client"
echo "  4. Client connects to game server"

echo ""
echo "üöÄ To run the secure system:"

echo ""
echo "1. Start Matchmaker Service (needs EDGEGAP_TOKEN):"
echo "   export EDGEGAP_TOKEN=\"your-token-here\""
echo "   cargo run --bin matchmaker --features matchmaker"

echo ""
echo "2. Start Game Server (no token needed):"
echo "   cargo run -p server"

echo ""
echo "3. Start Client (no token needed):"
echo "   cargo run -p client"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Security Benefits:"
echo "  - EDGEGAP_TOKEN never exposed to client code"
echo "  - Token only exists on secure server infrastructure"
echo "  - Client uses standard HTTP API for matchmaking"
echo "  - Easier to manage and rotate tokens"

echo ""
echo "üìù Configuration:"
echo "  Client config (client/src/screens/lobby.rs):"
echo "    - MATCHMAKER_API_URL (default: http://localhost:3000)"
echo "  Matchmaker config (server/src/matchmaker.rs):"
echo "    - EDGEGAP_TOKEN (required)"
echo "    - EDGEGAP_BASE_URL (default: https://api.edgegap.com)"
echo "    - PORT (default: 3000)"

echo "üîç Verification:"
echo "  Run './test-security-fix.sh' to verify the fix"
