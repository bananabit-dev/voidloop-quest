## Void Loop Quest


Check out my game website: [voidloop.quest](https://voidloop.quest)
This is my Bevy game project my goal is to make a racing game where you race against times from other users in a adventure setting and procedural maps so that there can be 100 variations of one map and each variation has its own record.It also should have a Map editor and it should take place in a 3d world but as a platformer the goal is to create a asset pipeline using LLM tools. I just generated the Logo this is the initial version and i rework that version to get a cleaned up version.

SO now this is my generated version after several tries generating an image i created this with LLM tools.

Now my goal is to translate this into a Vector graphic with Letters Only and one highlithing the thing behind.now i come back to writing i worked on the letters for about 2 - 3 hours now and it looks great.pfff still on it i made the letters "VOID", this is quite time consuming... im making progress im now at U btw check out my page voidloop.quest this is for the game im working on.
